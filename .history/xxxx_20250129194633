currying transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into series of function that takes one argument that takes one argument each 
multiply(2,3,4)
multiply(2)(2)(4)
firstly the function should take argm=ument at a time 
then after it should return the function with one arguments
then after the thing this should continue until it should arrive the result is computed 
use closures 
each function should return a new function keeping track of prevoulsy passed values
using closures 
either fix the function to always take three argumnents
or make it flexible using recursion
